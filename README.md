geosync_client
==============

This is a Java project based on the http://geosynkronisering.no/.    This will implement the client part of http://www.geosynkronisering.no/files/skjema/1.0/geosyncreplication.wsdl .  This code depends on https://github.com/larsop/geosync_base

To run the code you need to set your eviroment.

export GEOSYNC_WS_ENV=test1.

Now there is no GUI and the code is only a skeleton to show that this code can connect to a windows server.
